Welcome to the Word to Report Conversion wiki.

Word to Report Conversion is a tool designed to take the legwork out of creating standard document-type reports. Simply type up your document in Word, and let the tool analyse your document and produce a report format such as Jasper Reports jrxml.

This tool is currently in development, and here are some of the features that are currently supported.
* Output to jrxml
* Basic ability to switch between different band types (background, title, page header, column header, detail, column footer, page footer, last page footer, summary, no data)
* Left, right, and first line indenting
* Top and bottom paragraph spacing
* Paragraph alignment (left, right, center, justified)
* Inline character styling, including font, size, colour, bold, italic, underline, strike through

Other features that will be implemented.
* Ability to specify fields and parameters by Jasper notation $F{xyz} and $P{zyx}
* Generation of a dummy query based upon the fields in the document
* Paragraph bullets
