Convert Word documents into reporting tool formats such as Jasper Reports jrxml

Previously when working with JasperReports, I had to convert Word documents into Jasper Reports.
There were no tools to do this conversion, so after it was too difficult to create a professional
looking document in quick time, I created a Word macro called Word2Jasper, which took the leg work
out of the design.

This project is re-creating the functionality of that macro, but is built from scratch in C# using
.Net 4.5, and is built to support a Word 2010 add in, plus extra functionality.
